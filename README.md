## 📌 Project Overview

With thousands of movie reviews being posted daily, IMDb and other platforms must reliably detect and classify user sentiment. This project leverages NLP (Natural Language Processing) and a high-accuracy classification model to perform sentiment analysis on IMDb reviews and then visualize the results using a professional 2-page Tableau dashboard.

- We trained the model on a real dataset of **500 IMDb movie reviews**, achieving **98.4% model accuracy**.
- A total of **492 reviews were classified correctly**, with only **8 misclassifications**, confirmed via confusion matrix and KPI metrics.
- Confidence scores were notably high:  
  - **Avg Confidence:** 0.9732  
  - **Positive Predictions:** 97.60%  
  - **Negative Predictions:** 97.04%

## 🧩 Business Problem

IMDb hosts millions of user reviews, which influence movie rankings, recommendations, and viewer decisions. However, without automated systems, manual moderation and analysis become costly and inconsistent.

Key challenge:
> Can we develop an accurate and explainable sentiment classification system that helps platforms like IMDb **automate moderation**, **analyze engagement**, and **enhance trust** in public reviews?

---

## 🎯 Project Objective

- Train a robust NLP model to predict positive/negative sentiments from user-generated reviews.
- Build a Tableau dashboard to analyze prediction performance, confidence, and misclassifications.
- Ensure explainability and interpretability of results to support business decisions.

## 💼 Business Recommendations

If IMDb or any review-centric platform adopts this model and dashboard:

1. **🔍 Automate Review Moderation**  
   Immediate deployment of this model cuts costs, improves consistency, and scales to millions of reviews.

2. **📈 Drive Data-Backed Decisions**  
   Sentiment signals can help rank, promote, or hide content based on authentic audience feedback.

3. **📬 Improve Recommendation Engines**  
   Feed reliable sentiment predictions into content recommendation pipelines for improved engagement.

4. **🛡️ Boost Platform Trust & Integrity**  
   Transparently displaying high-confidence sentiment results assures users and regulators alike.

5. **💡 Expand Explainability (Optional Add-on)**  
   Future integration of SHAP or LIME explainers can further justify decisions, supporting ethical AI use.
